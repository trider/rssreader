=====================

RSS reader created with Angular and Ionic:

* The left side allows selecting, adding and removing RSS feeds. 
* The right side displays the currently selected RSS feed.

## Main screen
1. Header - showing the URL of the feed
1. Content - showing the feed items

The feed items themselves should be written as a directive that displays the title, date, and body.
